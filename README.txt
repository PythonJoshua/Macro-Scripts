Please ignore the 'shopping-bag.ico' file, this is just the logo for each product I create, deleting this will result in the programs not opening. (I think)
For every single program the hotkey / trigger is 'q' and will trigger a set of keys, or whatever the program does.

Create a 'ISSUE' if you need support or want to give me a suggestion!
